# Plant Disease Classification using Inception Model

## Overview:
This project aims to classify plant diseases using the Inception model, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The dataset used for this project is the New Plant Diseases Dataset available on Kaggle, containing images of various plant diseases and healthy plant samples.

## Goals:
1. Implement the Inception model for plant disease classification.
2. Apply transfer learning concepts to fine-tune the model and analyze its performance.
3. Compare the results obtained through fine-tuning with those obtained using feature selection techniques.
4. Provide insights and analysis on the effectiveness of transfer learning in the context of plant disease classification.

## Dataset:
The New Plant Diseases Dataset contains a large collection of images categorized into different classes representing various plant diseases and healthy plant samples. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models for plant disease detection.
